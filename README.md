## **Features**
### NAVIGATION BAR ON ALL PAGES WITH ACTIVE HIGHLIGHT
  ![Nav Bar](static/readme-images/desktopnav.png)

  ![Nav Bar](static/readme-images/mobilenav.png)

   -  My very first project with Code Institute was a Blog Site and I mentioned there that I think the most important thing about a website is the navigation bar, to me it should not be complicated to use it and it should be visible with easy to the eyes color. My navbar turns into a toggle button when the screen size go smaller. The Navigation bar also highlights what page the user is currently in. Up until today, this is still something I think should be necessary nothing beats simplicity  

### CAPTURING USERS ATTENTION WITH CAROUSEL 

  ![carousel](static/readme-images/carousel.mp4)

   -  As a user one thing that attracts me to use a website is a short homepage with a short description of what it is all about. To me when the home page is too long and too wordy, it is already a turn off form me. This may differ to different people so this is only base on my personal preference. The photo I think adds a personal touch. 

### SOCIAL LINKS

  ![Social Links](static/readme-images/footerandsocialmedia.png)

  - In this day and age, Social Media is everywhere and 99% of the population probably has one, so having social links on all pages of your website not only makes your website look aesthestically pleasing but as well as it could help users find your easier. Especially when you are offering services. 


### review
  ![Reviews](static/readme-images/review.png)

  - Putting a few reviews instantly visible gives a massive inpact to the users without having to be looking around.


### ADMIN FUNCTIONALITY
  ![admin ](static/readme-images/AdminFunctionality.png)

  - Having a Link that you can download pdf files are very important when it comes to websites that provide information. 

  ### CONTACT PAGE 
  ![Contact Page](static/readme-images/contact.png)

  - Contact Pages I think is one of the most usefukl pages in a website, it provides user comfort that they can reach out to someone if they do have additional information. 

  ### REGISTER PAGE 
  ![Register Page](static/readme-images/register.png)

  - This site is for a member only Travel Assistance Site . 

### **Language Used**
  - English

### **Navigation Bar**
- I have used Materialized for my Navigation bar which basic functionality for easy use. Using Bootstrap helps with the mobile first functionality of my website. Apart from this I have also added a highlight on the current page that the user is on. 

### **Landing Page**
- My landing page speaks for itself, the cover photo shows what the site is for and about. It also has my personal introduction which explains about the site. 

### **Footer**
- Social Media links which uses fontawesome icons to make it look appealing.

### **Future Features**
- I was hoping to add a little bit more pages to offer other services but I havent got a lot of time to finish this project.

## **Testing**
### Bugs and Issues

  - #### IDE Issues
    - My IDE crashed because I cleared my cookies and it caused my HEROKO to logged me out and lock me out, it took me a while to figure it out but then It was showing in GITHUB that the HEROKU was failing. Relaize that I was also logged out from the CI student account. 
  - #### Code Issues
    
    - While creating my flask app, I could not seem to load up the site at first, reason because the version was not correct. I did a little bit of research and tried it out myself but could not fix it. With the help of student support they pointed me to the right direction.

    - On the earliest stage of building the site, I didn't have much issues with coding but then. When I was trying to code a Delete route that passes to a Materialize Modal, I could not seem to pass it through the modal only to find out that instead of using the user I added username. This is for the delte functionality in the Admin page.

    - The same issue occured when I was trying to figure out to Delete the current Travel request passing through Materialize Modal. It keeps saying that I have too many reroutes to the newTravel page, removing the the redirection code in the newTravle,html but it causes my admin page to fail. I tried to find a way to fix it without creating another page but the only feesable solution was to create another page that renders the travel info data the same as the newTravel. 

    - Making my website responsive to screen size:

          Apart from bootstrap I also have used media queries which I followed from "LOVE RUNNING mini project"

### **HTML Validatior Test**

    It showed quite a few errors that I have already fixed but I wasn't able to get a screenshot of.

## **Deployment & Usage**
### **Deployment**
To deploy my site on Git Hub I made the following steps. I found out how to deploy my project when I was playing around with github trying to fix my incorrect path which hinders my images to load up on live. 

These are the steps:

 - Go to the Settings tab of your GitHub repo.
 - On the left-hand sidebar, in the Code and automation section, select Pages.
 - Make sure: Source is set to 'Deploy from Branch'.
 - Main branch is selected.
 - Folder is set to / (root).
 - Under Branch, click Save.
 - Go back to the Code tab. Wait a few minutes for the build to 
 - finish and refresh your repo.
 - On the right-hand side, in the Environments section, click on 'github-pages'.
 - Click View deployment to see the live site

### **Fork**
  1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to the experience-croatia repository.
  2.  In the top-right corner of the page, click Fork.
  3.  Under "Owner," select the dropdown menu and click an owner for the forked repository.
  4.  By default, forks are named the same as their upstream repositories. Optionally, to further distinguish your fork, in the "Repository name" field, type a name.
  5.  Optionally, in the "Description" field, type a description of your fork.
  6.  Optionally, select Copy the DEFAULT branch only.
  7.  Click Create fork.

### **Cloning**
  1.  On GitHub.com, navigate to your fork of the Spoon-Knife repository.
  2.  Above the list of files, click  Code.
  3.  Copy the URL for the repository.
    - To clone the repository us
    itory using an SSH key, including a certificate issued by your organization's SSH certificate authority, click SSH, then click .
    - To clone a repository using GitHub CLI, click GitHub CLI, then click .
  4.  Open Git Bash.
  5.  Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory.
  6.  Type git clone, and then paste the URL you copied earlier. It will look like this, with your GitHub username instead of YOUR-USERNAME:
  7.  Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.
